* Username is Unique
* Foreign key relationship between Usertable and Username table. Hence,
	getPassword is MAV and newUser is RC.
* Foreign key relationship between TweetID, Userline and Timeline. Hence,
	newTweet is RC, and getTimeline and getUserline is MAV.
* followUser, blockUser should be seen by getFollowers.
* followUser, unfollowUser should be seen by getFollowing.
* AddFollower is a bi-directional relationship composed of two independent
  actions. Hence, needs to be atomic.
* followUser needs to be RR in the presence of blockUser.

		def followUser (A {- me -}, B {- someone -}):
			(1) A.addFollowing (B); -> SUCCESS
			(2) B.addFollower (A); -> FAIL

		def blockUser (B {- me -}, A {- someone -}):
			(3) B.blocks(A);
			(4) A.isBlockedBy(B);

		Sequence of operations: 1,3,4,2. Some other transaction can see 1,2 but not
		3,4. Integrity constraint is violated!
* GetTweet should monotonically read NewTweets from the same session in order
  to see the tweets in order. This handles the case where long conversation is
  posted as a series of tweets.
* How to implement reply?
